# Cryptography
This is a project about cryptography algorithms written in C language.

The project includes various modules that showcase the implementation of different cryptographic algorithms.

## Introduction
This "Cryptography" project is a collection of cryptographic algorithms and techniques implemented in the C programming language. It was built as a project for a course in my college degree, with the aim of demonstrating an understanding of various cryptographic concepts and techniques.

The project includes the following modules:

* gcd.h
* inverse.h
* crt.h
* square-and-multiply.h
* primary-test.h
* diffie-hellman.h
* elliptic-curve.h
* solve-dlp.h
* rsa.h
* dsa.h
* rc4.h


Each module contains a comprehensive implementation of a specific algorithm and includes relevant explanations and examples of how to use it. The project serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about cryptography and its various applications.

The project provides a comprehensive overview of cryptography. Whether you're interested in learning more about cryptography, or are just looking for a starting point for your own cryptographic projects, this project is a great place to begin.

`square-and-multiply.h`: Implements the square-and-multiply algorithm for efficient modular exponentiation.

`primary-test.h`: Implements the Miller-Rabin primality test for determining whether a number is prime or composite.

`diffie-hellman.h`: Implements the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm for securely exchanging keys over a public channel.

`elliptic-curve.h`: Implements the Elliptic Curve cryptography algorithm for efficient encryption and decryption.

`solve-dlp.h`: Implements the algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem.

`rsa.h`: Implements the RSA algorithm for public-key encryption and digital signatures.
